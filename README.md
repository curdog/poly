CSC 265 â€“ Program 3

Due:  Wednesday May 1, 10 minutes before class starts

Write a calculator program that works with polynomials.  Use overloaded operators.  Your program should present a welcome screen, and ask the user to choose an option.  The allowable options are:
Enter Polynomial 1
Enter Polynomial 2
Addition
Subtraction
Quit

After entering a polynomial, it remains stored until the user chooses to enter another.  This allows the user to execute both operators on the same input if they wish.

A polynomial consists of:
1. x-squared term
2. x-term
3. ones-term

For example, a polynomial with values: 3, -2, and 4 would represent:
3x2-2x+4 (note: entered from keyboard as: 3x^2-2x+4, no spaces anywhere)

Note: values may be positive, negative, or 0. (I might enter: 2x^2+0x-3)

Your program should have the following operators overloaded:
Mathematical (+, -)
Input / Output (<<, >>)

Keep in mind the following:
Name your source files poly.h, poly.cpp, and main.cpp.
With invalid data, your program should respond appropriately.
Each function prototype should have a description, preconditions, and postconditions.
Test your code when you think you are finished.  Try to break it.  After you are done trying to break it, I will then try.

Good Luck!  Remember, questions are encouraged.  J
